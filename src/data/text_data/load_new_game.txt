In the enchanting realm of Eldoria, a land woven with magic and mystery, a prophecy unfolds, foretelling of an ancient artifact-the Heartstone. This legendary gem is said to hold the key to ultimate power, capable of shaping reality and endowing its wielder with unimaginable strength. As the prophecy gains momentum, adventurers from every corner of Eldoria flock to the city of Astralhaven.

You, an aspiring adventurer in search of renown and wealth, make your entrance in Mottengard, a quaint village nestled just before the looming dark forests. Your destination is Astralhaven, beckoned by the call of the Elderglyphs-the ruling council. They summon heroes to embark on a perilous quest, seeking the Heartstone and safeguarding it from falling into the clutches of malevolent forces.

Prepare for an odyssey that will not only challenge your skills but also test the very core of your courage and determination in the magical expanse of Eldoria. The mystical journey awaits, and the Heartstone's secrets are yours to uncover.

You arrive in Mottengard by caravan, a small village on the outskirts of the Dark Forest of Mythros.
